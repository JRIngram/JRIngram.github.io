	<h2>About Me</h2>
	<p>Hey there, I'm Jamie. I'm a student at Aston University studying Computer Science. I enjoy attending hackathons and other social technology events; this lead me to be one of the organisers for <a href="https://astonhack.co.uk/" target="_blank"> AstonHack</a> in 2016, and again in 2018.</p>
	<p>Outside of Computer Science, I enjoy reading, playing bass guitar, finding new music to listen to, playing tabletop games, playing badminton and have recently started bouldering. In general, I'd say I have a passion for learning and taking part in new experiences.</p>

	<p>Whilst studying at Aston University, most of my learning has been centred around Java, SQL, HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Thus these languages are my strongest areas. I have also managed to gain some experience in PHP and Python. Because of this, I have a strong understanding of Object-Oriented principles.</p>
	<p>Throughout projects both at University and side projects in my spare time, I have made considerable use of Git and performed the majority of the programming on Ubuntu, making me somewhat comfortable with both Git and Linux.</p>
	<p>Previously I have worked as a Software Developer at <a href="https://beautifulcanoe.com/" target="_blank">Beautiful Canoe</a>. During this time I worked on the Pharmacy Learning Environment, an examination system for Pharmacy students to use which would check they understood pharmacy law and prescriptions. As this was a web based project, my work was heavily focused on web technologies whilst using agile methodologies.</p>
	<h2>Featured Projects</h2>
	<p><b class="projectTitle"><a href="https://github.com/JRIngram/Word_Guesser" target ="_blank">Word_Guesser:<a/></b> A game written in Java, inspired by Fallout's hacking minigame. This desktop application provides the user with 10 words (either real words, or a randomly generated string of letters), and one of these words is chosen by the program as the correct word. The user has 4 guesses to find the correct word; with each guess the user is given the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamming_distance" target="_blank">Hamming Distance</a> of the chosen word vs the 'correct' word.</p>
	<p><b class="projectTitle"><a href="https://github.com/JRIngram/FiLo" target ="_blank">FiLo:</a></b> A dummy website to demonstrate my knowledge of client-side and server side programming, using PHP, JavaScript, HTML and CSS. The idea behind this website is that a user would post lost items that they have found e.g. a lost necklace, another user would log-on to the website and see their lost necklace and 'claim' the item.</p>
	<p><b class="projectTitle"><a href="https://github.com/JRIngram/GAExperiment/commits/master" target ="_blank">Genetic Algorithm Experiment:</b></a> Software written originally written in Java to teach myself the basics of genetic algorithms. Currently it uses basic reproduction, crossover and mutation algorithms. In future I would like to make these more complex, and allow the user to switch between the different algorithms. In future I would like to allow this piece of open source software to become an educational tool so that others can benefit from my experimentations when learning about genetic algorithms.
