	<h2>About Me</h2>
	<p>Hey there, I'm Jamie. I'm a student at Aston University studying Computer Science. I enjoy attending hackathons and other social technology events; this lead me to be one of the organisers for <a href="https://astonhack.co.uk/"> AstonHack</a> in 2016, and again in 2018.</p>
	<p>Outside of Computer Science, I enjoy reading, playing bass guitar, finding new music to listen, playing badminton and have recently started bouldering. In general, I'd say I have a passion for learning and taking part in new experiences.</p>

	<p>Whilst studying at Aston University, most of my learning has been centred around Java, SQL, HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Thus these languages are my strongest areas. I have also managed to gain some experience in PHP and Python. Because of this, I have a strong understanding of Object-Oriented principles.</p>
	<p>Throughout projects both at University and side projects in my spare time, I have made considerable use of Git and performed the majority of the programming on Ubuntu, making me somewhat comfortable with both Git and Linux.</p>
	<p>Previously I have worked as a Software Developer at <a href="https://beautifulcanoe.com/">Beautiful Canoe</a>. During this time I worked on the Pharmacy Learning Environment, an examination system for Pharmacy students to use which would check they understood pharmacy law and prescriptions. As this was a web based project, my work was heavily focused on web technologies.</p>
